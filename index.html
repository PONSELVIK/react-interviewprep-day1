        <p>1. WHAT IS VIRTUAL DOM</p>
       <p>
        Virutual Dom [VDOM] is an in-memory representation of real Dom.The representation of UI is kept in memory
        and synced with Real dom. Its a step between the render function is being called and displaying element on the screen.
        this entire process is called reconcilation.
       </p> 
       <p>2.What is SPA</p>
       <P>
        Single Page Application: Any web application when we click the button or when we try to select any tabs in navbar
        then the browser page will get reloading that is known as Multi page-application.instead of any changes without reloading 
        the page is known as single-page-application. it is not taking loading time, faster than MPA. <br>
        when we create a  react application using CRA [create-react-app appname]then its an single page application.

       <p>3.DIFFERNCE BETWEEN CLASS AND FUNCIONAL COMPONENT</p>
       <p>
        FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>It is like a plain javascript function which passed props as arguments and return react element.</li>
            <li>there is no render menthod.</li>
            <li>also known as stateless component which accept data and display some form, mainly used for rendering UI</li>
            <li>Life cycle method not used in functional component.[eg componentDidMount]</li>
            <li>constructor is not used in functioal component</li>
            <li>Hooks are simply used to make them statefull.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CLASS COMPONENT</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It requires render from React.Component and create a render function and returns react element</li>
            <li>must have render()method returning jsx</li>
            <li>also known as statefull component.</li>
            <li>constructor is used to store state</li>
            <li>life cycle method is used in class component.</li>
            </ul>
       </p>
       <p>4.WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY STATE AND ITS USE IN REACT</p>
       <P>
        State is an object hold some information may change over the lifetime of the component. state is always try to make simple.
        <pre>
            class comp extends React.Component{
                constructor(props){
                    super(props)

                    this.state ={
                        message : "react"
                    }
                }
                render(){
                    return(
                        div>
                            h1>{this.state.message}/h1>
                        /div>
                )
                }
            }
        </pre>
        state is used for internal communication inside react component <br>
        state is similar to props but it is private and fully accessed by component.other component can not use without any access.
       </P>

       <p>5.WHAT IS JSX WHY WE USE INSTEAD OF JS?</p>
       <p>
        JSX is a javascript XML. it is used to write html in react. <br>
        jsx makes the code easier to write html in react. <br>
        jsx allow us to write HTML in javascript and place them indom without any CreateElement()or appendChild() <br>
        jsx converts html tags in react elements 
    </p>
    <p>6.WHAT IS PACKAGE.JSON?</p>
    <P>
        It contain the information about the project and the libraries which using inthe project and has contain the description of the 
        commands which is run test and build the projects.
    </P>
